RPSA allow users to place a pin at any location, give it a name, describe it, and categorize it. Anyone can register for an account using first name, last name, email, and password. Once registered users can add pins, modify pins, and delete pins. All users see the same pins, they are globally not for each individual user.

RPSA was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, leaflet, Python, SQLite, and PostgreSQL. The client side uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Leaflet provides the map and location functionality. Python was used for server. Bcrypt was used for encrypting passwords. SQLite and PostgreSQL were used for database.
